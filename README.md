# fs-cleaner-rs
Delete your files, now blazingly fast! (On Windows)

## Why a tool for file deletion?
Someone had a problem with deleting a file used by an active process. So I researched 5 minutes, and wrote a script in 10 to delete files on reboot. 

## Usage
Just run the program from your GUI, or terminal via
```cmd
fs-cleaner-rs.exe
```
and then just follow the instructions in your terminal.
